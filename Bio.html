        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <h3>4th Year Computer Science Student at University of Maryland, Baltimore County</h3>
        <p>Ever since high school, I have had a growing interest 
            in software engineering. Throughout college, 
            I have learned extensively what goes into 
            becoming a great programmer. From clean code 
            to efficient algorithms, it has been my goal 
            to take each concept I learn and apply it to 
            personal projects.
            <br><br>
            Now that I am approaching the end of my college career,
            I am looking to extend my skills into the industry. 
            While school has taught me a lot about the theory 
            behind computer science, my goal with an internship 
            is to learn within a team of experienced programmers. 
            I believe that the best way to expand your craft is 
            to surround yourself with experts in that field. 
            An internship provides these opportunities as well 
            as a chance to grow with the company. I would love 
            the chance to join your team!</p>
